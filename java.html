								<h3 class="t2">history of java</h3>
								<p class="d2">Java started with the name green project. First it was made for the consumer electronics market but after finishing it it was clear that it was more than that. To create java a man called James Gosling was given a task to find a programming language for it. His first choice was c++ but it complexity made it hard to choose so he made 
								Another language is called Oka, the first name for java and this programming language was special because it was compiled and interpreted to give it speed and to run on every platform out there.</p>
								
								<p class="d3">Unlike other programming languages at that time java was a compiled and interpreted language this meant that to run java first the source code changed to byte-code by compiler than the interprented run the program.Bytecode is program code that has been compiled from source code into low-level code designed for a software interpreter.i said before that the name for java was oka renamed in the name of the oka 
								tree in their office but they changed its name to java because when they were making the language they were drinking lots of coffee so they called it java. After finishing it it was so powerful for just the commercial electronic market so they applied it for web server applications and the first way to use it in their server was netescape.    </p>

								<h4 class="t3">Future of java</h4>
								<p><b>1.</b><span class="d4">One of the future of java is that it is purely object-oriented unlike c++ that is partially object-oriented this means that even the basic
								code has to be encapsulated in class.</span></p>
								<p><b>2.</b><span class="d5">Another future is that it can work on almost all platforms starting with Windows,Linux,Android, even in cars and watch that make him so powerful</span></p>

								<p><b>3.</b><span class="d6">it has a mecanisim called garbage collection that deletes unused class and objects in aother programming languages you need to do this by you self
								but java provide a method to make this easy.</span></p>
